1. We use parcel as a dev dependency which is a bundler that's going to compile our typescript files.
2. The parcel is going automatically detect the ts file and transpile into js file
3. run parcel --help to go through the commands required
4. write scripts in package.json to transpile the ts files and reload the web browser on any changes.
5. remove main from package.json sp parcel doesn't throw any error otherwise it will keep looking for index.js file
